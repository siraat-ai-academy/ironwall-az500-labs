# 🔐 Real-World Reflection: A 158-Year Legacy Lost to One Weak Password

> _“One password. One moment. 158 years of legacy — gone.”_

🌸 From **Lab 14 onward** in this IronWall AZ-500 journey, we plant a gentle but powerful reminder at the end of each lab.  
A single paragraph. A single story. A whole world of consequence.

## 📜 Why This Reflection Matters

Security is no longer a technical luxury — it is a human necessity.  
In 2023, a company with **158 years of trust** was brought down by a **single weak password**.  
Over **700 people lost their jobs**. A name built over generations vanished overnight.

So from Lab 14 onward, every output will end with this:

---

### 🔐 Real-World Reflection: A 158-Year Legacy Lost to One Weak Password

A unique paragraph relating the Azure lab topic (like Key Vaults, NSGs, Defender, etc.)  
to the painful reality that **one misstep can bring everything down**.

It is to **ground you**. To inspire you. To prepare you.
