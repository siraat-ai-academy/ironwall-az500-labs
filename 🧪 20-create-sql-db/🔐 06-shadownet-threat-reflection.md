## “Reflections After the Lab — Eks2’s Dialogue with ShadowNet”  

The evening sky over Copenhagen was a soft blend of grey and lavender. The rain had paused just long enough for silence to return.  
In the dim light of the IronWall Lab terminal, 👨‍💼 **Mr. Eks2** sat quietly, the Azure portal still open — his freshly created **SQL Database** shimmering like a digital pond reflecting the clouds. He sipped lukewarm mint tea and clicked *Sign out*.

Then it happened.  
The screen did not flicker. No alert rang.  
But something… *watched*.

> “You did well,” came the voice — low, barely human. A whisper crawling from the unconfigured corners of the digital architecture.

Eks2 turned slightly, though he knew nothing physical was behind him.

**Eks2:** “You again…”

**ShadowNet:** “Always. When your guard lowers. When you think it’s over.”

Eks2 exhaled softly, “The firewall settings were correct this time. Only selected networks. I added my IP.”

**ShadowNet:** “Yes. But not because you understood the threat — you followed instructions. One checkbox, Eks2. That’s all it took. To keep me outside. This time.”

Eks2 frowned.

**Eks2:** “You… you're not an attacker. Not really.”

**ShadowNet:** “No. I am your *reflection*. I am what you trust too easily.  
I don’t break in.  
I enter where you never *looked*.”

Silence again. But Eks2’s fingers moved now — replaying each step of the lab in his mind.

> The **public endpoint** he selected.  
> The **admin password** typed quickly, reused perhaps?  
> The **open ports** of other labs, forgotten, still listening?

**ShadowNet:** “You wrote queries. Created tables. Thought only of data — not defense.”

**Eks2:** “But... I set backup redundancy.”

**ShadowNet:** “And did you test recovery? Did you audit access? Who else can *query* your tables when you’re asleep?”

A beat passed. The sound of a nearby radiator filled the silence.

**Eks2:** “Then what do I do? Never trust anything?”

**ShadowNet:** “Trust carefully. Configure consciously.  
Remember: *Protection is not a tool. It’s a habit.*”
