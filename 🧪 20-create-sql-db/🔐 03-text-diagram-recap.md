## 💬 Post-Lab Scene: Eks2 Looks at the Board  

The lab had ended.

The rain had started to patter gently outside the windows of IronWall’s learning lounge.  
Everyone was unwinding — tea cups steaming, laughter soft, laptops closed but hearts still open.

On the wall, someone had drawn a diagram — boxes, arrows, lines. It showed what they’d just built in the lab.

**Mr. eks2** tilted his head, eyes calm but curious.

> “This looks… nice. But what does it all mean?”  

**Sofia** smiled.

**Kasper** stood up with his marker and said,  
**“Let’s walk through it. Not just what it *does* — but what it *means*.”**

## 🎭 Diagram Walkthrough — The IronWall Way  

### 🎒 **Resource Group (RG-NordicVault)**  

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “Think of this like your suitcase — you put all related items inside. If you're traveling with a database, server, and firewall? Keep them zipped together in one *ressourcegruppe*.”  

**🇪🇸 Sofia**: “It also helps with cleanup. One delete — and poof, all test resources are gone. No billing surprises.”

**🇵🇰 I.K.**: “To contain is to respect. Structure protects memory. It’s the digital way of saying *Bismillah* before building.”

**🇨🇳 Maya Lin**: “So a Resource Group is like a cozy drawer? Everything I need, together?”  

**🕶️ ShadowNet**: loves loose resources floating without order. He thrives in forgotten corners.

### 🧠 **SQL Server: Vault-SQL01**  

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “This is your doorman. It holds your databases, asks ‘Who are you?’ before letting anyone in.”

**🇮🇹 Isabella**: “People reuse weak passwords. Teach them: the stronger the guardian, the safer the knowledge.”

**🇷🇺 Elina**: “In Bicep, I set naming conventions with `sql-<env>-<region>`. Easy for automation. Elegant for audits.”

**🇪🇸 Inky Rihan**: “Guess what happens when you name your server `test123` and leave the login as `admin`? I walk in.”

**👨‍💼 Mr. eks2**: “I wrote in my notes: ‘A server is not the data. It’s the doorway.’ That helps me.”

---

### 🧱 **SQL Database: UniData**  

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “A database is a library. This one stores students, courses, and grades. No rows? No records. No meaning.”

**🇪🇸 Sofia**: “Choose the right tier. For learning, **Basic** is enough. But always plan for growth — and backup!”

**🇵🇰 I.K.**: “Knowledge without resilience is arrogance. Use redundancy — because life is fragile, and data even more so.”

**🇨🇳 Maya Lin**: “Backups are like... memory insurance! I love that.”

**🕶️ ShadowNet**: always checks if backup is off… and waits for disaster.

---

### 🌐 **Public Endpoint + Firewall**  

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “You gave the database a phone number. But now you must control who can dial in.”

**🇪🇸 Sofia**: “Set Public access to **Selected networks**. Add your IP. And only check *Allow Azure Services* when needed.”

**🇮🇹 Isabella**: “Sometimes we leave things open ‘just for now’. Humans forget. ShadowNet remembers.”

**🇷🇺 Elina**: “I lock down everything by default in my ARM templates. Principle of least surprise.”

**🇪🇸 Inky Rihan**: “Open port 1433 without limits? I scan it. I exploit it. End of story.”

**🇨🇳 Maya Lin**: “So my IP was like giving my name at the door?”

**👨‍💼 Mr. eks2**: “It felt... respectful. Like telling the server: ‘Only I may enter.’”

---

### 🧾 **Query Editor + Tables**  

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “This is where you speak SQL. Every `CREATE TABLE` is like building a shelf in your library.”

**🇪🇸 Sofia**: “And foreign keys? They’re relationships. They remind us that data, like people, need structure and belonging.”

**🇷🇺 Elina**: “I keep all my SQL scripts version-controlled. It’s like journaling for databases.”

**🇮🇹 Isabella**: “Too many people copy-paste without thinking. Teach them to pause. Understand. Breathe.”

**🇪🇸 Inky Rihan**: “One vulnerable query... one exposed table… and I see it all.”

**🇨🇳 Maya Lin**: “It felt like... telling stories to the database. About students. About courses. About learning.”

**👨‍💼 Mr. eks2**: “My favorite table was `credit`. Because even in data, effort gets recorded.”

## 🌍 Final Reflection — Mr. Eks2’s Notebook  

> “I see it now. Everything flows. From group, to server, to database, to query — like a Danish river guided by tiny gates.”

He smiled and jotted gently in his notebook:

- **SQL Database** [SQL-database]  
- **Firewall Rule** [Firewall-regel]  

> “Structure gives safety. Language gives life.”

## 🔐 Real-World Whisper: A 158-Year Legacy Lost  

One weak password — one forgotten setting — that’s all it took to end a legacy of 158 years.  
This diagram, though simple, is a reminder: **structure is safety**. Every NSG, every database, every firewall rule must be made with care.  

Because behind every config… is a company, a family, a future.
