# Interview Task – Quick Recall Sheet  
**Lab 20 – Create a SQL Database**  
🌸 _Soft reflections from IronWall Guardians — for memory that lasts beyond interviews._

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Navigated to “Create a Resource”  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen**:  
“Every Azure journey starts here — your friendly airport terminal to the cloud.”  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera**:  
“It’s always better to search directly for what you need — clarity before clicks.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Selected SQL Database  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen**:  
“This is like choosing your destination: we’re building a secure data home.”  
😇 **Maya Lin**:  
“Ohh! So instead of Excel, I’m using real cloud tables now?”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Chose Existing Resource Group  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera**:  
“Organizing resources helps with cost tracking, security, and cleanup.”  
🧠 **I.K.**:  
“We begin within order — intention before infrastructure.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 4: Created New SQL Server  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen**:  
“Your database needs a bodyguard — this is that gatekeeper.”  
🕶️ **ShadowNet** *(unseen)*:  
“Name it something silly or reuse defaults — and I might just listen.”  
🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova**:  
“I always automate this with Bicep — predictable, repeatable, auditable.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 5: Set SQL Authentication with Admin Login  
🌸 **Isabella Konti**:  
“Never reuse old passwords. Teach users why strong identities matter.”  
🇵🇰 **I.K.**:  
“Identity is sacred. Who holds the key — holds the risk.”  
🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan**:  
“I watch for reused logins across environments. You’d be surprised.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 6: Disabled Elastic Pool, Chose Basic Tier  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen**:  
“Elastic pool is like co-working. But today we wanted our own quiet office.”  
😇 **Maya Lin**:  
“So Basic tier means I’m not paying for unused power?”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 7: Selected Local Redundant Backup  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera**:  
“For non-critical learning, local redundancy is fine — but don’t forget risk levels.”  
🧠 **I.K.**:  
“Backups are trust anchors. Fragile futures rely on thoughtful replication.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 8: Enabled Public Endpoint  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen**:  
“This is your phone line — but don’t forget to set caller ID.”  
🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan**:  
“If public, I test it. Always. People misconfigure this far too often.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 9: Set Networking — Only Selected Networks  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera**:  
“Always minimize exposure. ‘Selected networks’ = thoughtful access.”  
🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti**:  
“Humans forget. So don’t leave the door open ‘just this once.’”  
🕶️ **ShadowNet** *(waiting silently)*:  
“Misconfigured firewalls make me feel… welcomed.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 10: Added Client IP + Allowed Azure Services  
😇 **Maya Lin**:  
“I added my IP! It felt like unlocking the door just for me.”  
🇵🇰 **I.K.**:  
“Control is a blessing. Selective entry is not exclusion — it is respect.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 11: Accessed Query Editor  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen**:  
“SQL is your voice. This editor lets you speak to your data.”  
🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova**:  
“Keep your queries versioned — clarity comes from documentation.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 12: Ran SQL Script to Create Tables  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera**:  
“Tables are like shelves. Each one holds precious meaning.”  
🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan**:  
“I scan for exposed schema. If you forget to lock the drawer…”  
👨‍💼 **Mr. Eks2**:  
“I loved the `credit` table — a digital way of tracking effort and outcomes.”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 13: Confirmed Tables Were Created  
🌸 **Isabella Konti**:  
“Humans trust what they can see. Always confirm. Always validate.”  
😇 **Maya Lin**:  
“I clicked refresh 3 times just to be sure!”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 14: Deleted All Resources  
🇪🇸 **Sofia Zaymera**:  
“Cleanliness in cloud is like mindfulness in life. Always close what you open.”  
🇵🇰 **I.K.**:  
“End with grace. Release what you created — with intention.”

## 🌈 Final Reflection – by Mr. Eks2  

> “This lab was more than checkboxes.  
> Every step was like a verse in a story — where identity, structure, and silence mattered.”  
>  
> Today I wrote down:  
> - SQL Database [**SQL-database**]  
> - Firewall Rule [**Firewall-regel**]  
>  
> They are not just tools. They are promises.”

## 🔐 Real-World Reminder  

One weak password destroyed a 158-year-old firm.  
This lab taught us how to place guardrails — from login policies to firewalls — that stop **ShadowNet** before it gets in.  
Never underestimate the weight of one misconfiguration.
