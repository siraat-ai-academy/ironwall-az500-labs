## 📖 A Story in Tables, Trust, and Tiny Threats

It was a soft morning in Copenhagen. The clouds outside mirrored the ones in Azure. **Mr. Eks2** sat with his warm cup of tea, fingers gently tracing the Azure portal’s interface. This was no ordinary task — today, he would shape something sacred: **a database.**

> “So this is where lives begin?” he whispered, looking at the *Create SQL Database* button.

---

### ☁️ Scene 1: The Birth of a Digital Library

**Kasper** leaned over his shoulder, sipping from his Moomin-themed mug.  
> "Think of a **Resource Group** as a bookshelf, Eks2. Every database, every server, is a book. Keep them neat."

**Sofia** added,  
> "And don't forget — order brings clarity. Choose your **database name** as if naming a child."

**Eks2** smiled.  
> "Then... let it be ‘NordicStudentsDb’. I want to remember where it began."

---

### 🛡️ Scene 2: The Server of Secrets

He clicked **Create Server**, entering credentials like setting a lock on a treasure chest.

**Isabella** warned gently,  
> "What you name and protect today, someone might trust tomorrow."

**Inky Rihan** appeared like mist behind the UI.  
> "If you reuse weak credentials, Eks2... I’ll be the first to break through."

---

### 🔄 Scene 3: Skipping the Pool

**Maya Lin** asked,  
> "What is this *Elastic Pool*, Eks2?"

**Elina Petrova** responded,  
> "Like a shared power source — good for many databases, but not today."

---

### 🌐 Scene 4: The Public Portal Dilemma

**Eks2** set the **Connectivity Method** to *Public endpoint*.

There was a pause.

Then, **ShadowNet** stirred.

It didn’t speak.  
It blinked in the logs.  
It waited where firewalls falter.

**I.K.** whispered behind Eks2,  
> "Connectivity is a doorway. Ensure it's guarded with purpose."

---

### 🔒 Scene 5: Defending the Vault

**Eks2** clicked "Add my IP".

> “But what about others?” he asked.

**Sofia**: "That’s why you select only networks you trust. And always check the **‘Allow Azure Services’** box only when you mean it."

---

### 🧬 Scene 6: Four Tables, Four Lives

In the query editor, Eks2 wrote:

- A **Person** table, for identity  
- A **Student**, to connect purpose  
- A **Course**, for the path  
- And **Credit**, for the journey’s reward

Each `CREATE TABLE` echoed like poetry across the digital sky.

---

## 🌼 Final Reflection

**Eks2** stood by the window as Danish rain began to fall.

> “I see now. Each configuration is not just code. It’s responsibility, memory, and trust stitched into syntax.”

He wrote softly into his notebook:  
- SQL Server = *SQL-server*  
- Firewall = *Brandmur*
