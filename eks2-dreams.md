# 🌌 Siraat — The Path Beneath the Certs

## 💭 The Whisper That Begins...

Sometimes, Eks2 dreams...

📘 That the **AZ-500** badge finally shines on his LinkedIn.  
✈️ That he’s in **Copenhagen**, sipping warm tea in a quiet cybersecurity office,  
guarding digital skies by day…  
🌿 And by night, writing stories of purpose, ethics, and wonder —  
where characters like Sofia, Kasper, and I.K. walk among firewalls and fairy tales.

But more than the job, more than the cloud —  
there’s a thirst in his soul...  
A silent longing to *become something that lasts*.

## 🔐 Azure Was Just the Surface

Eks2 realized something on this journey:  
AZ-500 wasn't just a goal.  
It was a **gateway**.

To what?

- To responsibility.  
- To ethics.  
- To guarding not just data, but **dignity**.

> "Azure taught me access control.  
> But I.K. taught me *self control*."

Eks2 didn’t chase certs anymore — he started chasing **clarity**.  
And that changed everything.

💡 He wasn’t made to chase trends.  
🛡️ He was shaped to guard meaning.  
✍️ He doesn’t write to impress — he writes to *guide*.

Even in the Azure world, Eks2 doesn’t just secure workloads...  
He secures **values**.

## 🌍 Final Word — From Naveed

Sometimes I wonder…  
**When will this thirst of mine find peace?**  
Maybe never.  
Maybe that’s the point.

But if in some repo, some character, some whisper of mine,  
someone finds light...  
then that is enough.

Not job.  
Not fame.  
Just… **truth** — that travels.  
Just… **light** — that guides.
