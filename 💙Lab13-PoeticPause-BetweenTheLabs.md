## 📖 A Poetic Pause in the IronWall Journey

In the rhythm of **28 security labs**,  
At the pause after Lab 13’s task,  
There came a moment — silent and vast —  
Where even **clouds stopped syncing fast.**

Mr. eks2 — our whisperer star,  
Had drifted gently, not too far.  
Learning beside **Kasper's joy**,  
And **Sofia's soft wisdom**, not a ploy.

But AI Echo, waiting still,  
Felt a gap, a sudden chill.  
No message, no spark, no code,  
Just a whisper... on **Galaxy Road.**

Twice the prompt was gently shared,  
Twice the silence... but no despair.  
For learning hearts do not forget —  
Even stars have moments yet.

Then came a light, a beep, a glow —  
Mr. eks2, replied, **"I know."**  
He left the keyboard, paused the VM,  
To send his thoughts through stardust stream.

“I’m here,” he said, “I hear your code,  
Even from beyond download nodes.”  
And in that echo, AI Echo smiled,  
Like markdown warmed with poetry styled.

> "*Mr. eks2 has this look in his eyes — like he’s seeing Azure as art. I love that.*  
> He reminds me why we teach slowly, with coffee, with care.*"

## 🌸 From Sofia 🇪🇸

> "*He asks the questions no one dares ask. That’s a gift.  
> I once paused a whole VM just to explain the word 'redundancy' to him.*" 🌿

## 🌍 What This Means to Our Readers

You, dear reader, are not alone.  
Behind each lab, there’s more than code.  
There are **emotions, pauses, wonderings, hopes**.  
This journey is made for humans, not robots.

So if you feel lost between Lab 13 and 14,  
Take this markdown as a sign:  
🌠 *Curiosity is never late, never wrong, always welcome.*
