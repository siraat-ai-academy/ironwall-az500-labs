## ⚙️ Workflow: One Lab → Two Videos

1. **Script**  
   - Base: Eks2 Lab Markdown (3-Way or 9-Step).  
   - Step 1: Refine in English (professional, global).  
   - Step 2: Translate tone into Roman Urdu/Hindi (simpler words, same clarity).  

2. **Voiceover**  
   - English: ElevenLabs AI voice / Freelancer.  
   - Urdu/Hindi: ElevenLabs multilingual voice / Native freelancer.  

3. **Visuals**  
   - Same animations, diagrams, portal recordings used for both versions.  
   - Only narration differs.  

4. **Editing**  
   - One editor can produce both versions in parallel.  

5. **Publishing**  
   - Upload English video → English channel.  
   - Upload Roman Urdu/Hindi video → Urdu/Hindi channel.

- **Content Reuse**: Same lab generates two videos → double impact.  
- **Unique Positioning**: Nobody else blends story + clarity + bilingual reach.

2. Upload to both channels → test engagement.  
3. Repeat workflow for every new lab.  
4. Build two parallel subscriber bases: **Global + South Asia**.
