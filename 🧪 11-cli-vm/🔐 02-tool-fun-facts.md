# ☁️ Azure Tools Explained – After Lab 11 (Create a VM with CLI)

After finishing the lab, Mr. eks2 sits down with Kasper and Sofia on a soft Danish couch. He leans back and says:

**“That was a great lab… but what are all these tools really for?”** 🤔

Kasper grins. Sofia smiles warmly. And so begins their friendly chat over lukewarm tea and cloud wisdom…

## 🔧 Let’s Talk Azure Tools (Lab 11)

### 🧰 **Azure CLI**
**Kasper:** “Ah yes, the **Azure CLI**. It’s like giving Azure commands in your own words — kind of like texting the cloud! ‘Hey Azure, make me a virtual machine, please.’”

**Sofia:** “Yes, and it’s very useful for automating tasks. Just make sure you don’t store your passwords in plain text — use variables for security!”

**Mr. eks2:** “So I was actually *talking* to the cloud... no wonder it listened so well!”

---

### 🏠 **Resource Group**
**Kasper:** “Think of a **Resource Group** [ressourcegruppe] like a digital folder. Everything for one project — VM, network, IPs — goes in there. It keeps things tidy.”

**Sofia:** “And when you delete the folder, poof — everything inside disappears too. So double-check before clicking delete!”

**Mr. eks2:** “I like that. A cloud folder for all my toys.”

---

### 💻 **Virtual Machine (VM)**
**Kasper:** “The **Virtual Machine** is your pretend computer living in Azure. Like a ghost PC that’s very real, but you can’t spill coffee on it.”

**Sofia:** “Yes, and always set strong admin passwords — nothing like ‘1234’. Use 12+ characters with symbols.”

**Mr. eks2:** “It really did feel like magic to connect to it via RDP.”

---

### 🌐 **Virtual Network (VNet)**
**Kasper:** “A **Virtual Network** is like a private street your VM lives on. No one can drive in unless you open the gates.”

**Sofia:** “Those gates are controlled by things like **NSGs**. Keep them secure and don’t expose sensitive ports.”

**Mr. eks2:** “So I built a neighborhood... with just one house in it?”

---

### 🛡️ **Network Security Group (NSG)**
**Kasper:** “This is your digital bouncer. The **NSG** checks the guest list before anyone connects to your VM.”

**Sofia:** “Only allow what you need — for example, RDP on port 3389 — and block the rest.”

**Mr. eks2:** “I like the idea of a bouncer. Very VIP.”

---

### 🌍 **Public IP Address**
**Kasper:** “The **Public IP** is like the phone number to your VM. Without it, no one can call you — or connect.”

**Sofia:** “But always protect that number. Exposing services directly to the internet is risky.”

**Mr. eks2:** “So... my VM has its own number? Fancy.”

---

### 📦 **NIC (Network Interface Card)**
**Kasper:** “The **NIC** is what connects your VM to the VNet — kind of like plugging in the network cable.”

**Sofia:** “And through the NIC, NSGs and IP settings are applied. It’s the middleperson in the setup.”

**Mr. eks2:** “So that’s the invisible cord my VM uses to get online.”

## 💭 Final Reflection from Mr. eks2

> “I used to think Azure was just a big cloud. But now I see — it’s full of tiny parts working together. Like a digital city. And today, I’ll remember that **Virtuel Maskine** lives in a **Virtuelt netværk** — with a bouncer, of course.”
