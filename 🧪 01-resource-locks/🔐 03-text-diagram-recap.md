## 🎭 Diagram Walkthrough — Told Like a Story

### 🧑‍🏫 Kasper Explains:

“Okay, eks2, picture this like a little castle setup in the cloud!

At the top, we have the **Resource Group** — like a folder or box where you keep all your cloud stuff together. Ours is called **NordicVault-Group** — very secure, very Danish 🇩🇰.

Inside this group, we place our mighty **Virtual Machine** — named **NordicVault-VM**. It’s like your own private computer in the sky, running **Ubuntu Server**."

### 🔒 Sofia Adds:

“We added locks! A **Delete Lock** on the VM — so no one can delete it by accident. And a **Read-only Lock** on the whole **Resource Group**. These are our digital seatbelts.”

---

### 🤔 Mr. eks2 Reflects:

“So the **Virtual Machine** lives inside the **Resource Group**… and then we locked both! Like putting a bike in a garage and locking both the bike and the garage door?”

## 💡 Final Takeaway

This simple diagram teaches us how Azure resources are **grouped**, **protected**, and **structured**. By using **resource locks**, even beginners can set up a strong defense against accidental changes or deletions. It's not just cloud computing — it’s cloud safety.
