## ☕ Diagram Explained (Story Style)

### 🧑‍🚀 Mr. eks2:  
*(sipping tea)* “Okay, this looks cool. But… what am I actually looking at?”

---

### 🇩🇰 Kasper:  
“Imagine your **Resource Group** is a giant backpack 📦 — let’s call it **DKSec-RG**. Everything you build in Azure goes inside it. Your VM, your disk, your files... all neatly packed.”

> “We locked the backpack with a **Read-only** lock. So nobody can mess with what’s inside unless they unlock it first!”

---

### 🇪🇸 Sofia:  
“This is important in companies. A mistake in a live resource group can cost money or break systems.  
With a **read-only lock**, you protect the whole box — perfect for production environments.”

---

### 🧑‍🚀 Mr. eks2:  
“Oh! So even if I try to delete or change things... Azure says ‘Nope!’ unless I remove the lock first?”

---

### 🇩🇰 Kasper:  
“Exactly! Now inside that backpack is our superhero — **NordicVault-VM**. A solid **Virtual Machine** running Ubuntu. It’s your private computer in the cloud.”

> “We gave it its own **delete lock**. That means even if someone gets click-happy, they can’t remove it by accident.”

---

### 🇪🇸 Sofia:  
“This is a best practice. Always lock key resources like VMs, databases, and production environments.  
Locks give you that *extra breath* before a mistake happens.”

---

### 🧑‍🚀 Mr. eks2:  
“So it’s like seatbelts… for the cloud?”

---

### 🇩🇰 Kasper:  
“Cloud-belts! Yes! And look under the VM — you’ll see its **Disk**. We chose **Standard SSD**, and **Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)** to keep things safe and budget-friendly.”

---

### 🇪🇸 Sofia:  
“Disks are like your VM’s memory card. If the disk goes, the VM goes too.  
That’s why storage choice and redundancy matter — especially for uptime and performance.”

---

### 🧑‍🚀 Mr. eks2:  
“I’m starting to feel like a real cloud builder. Slowly. Kindly. Safely.”

## 🌍 Final Takeaway

This diagram shows how **Azure resources connect** inside a **Resource Group**, and how **locks** can protect critical components like **Virtual Machines** and storage.  
It teaches us to think with safety first — one cloud resource at a time.
