# Interview Task ‚Äì Quick Recall Sheet (Lab 18 ‚Äì Troubleshoot Routing, Load Balancing & Traffic Control)

---

- **Step 1: Created a Virtual Network (VNet)**  
  *To provide a private network environment in Azure*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Enables secure internal communication between resources, just like a digital neighborhood.

- **Step 2: Enabled Azure Bastion**  
  *To securely access virtual machines without public IPs*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Prevents exposure to the public internet while still allowing administrative access.

- **Step 3: Created NAT Gateway**  
  *To allow outbound internet access for VMs in a secure way*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Keeps internal VMs private while letting them reach external services (updates, downloads).

- **Step 4: Created a Load Balancer (Standard SKU)**  
  *To distribute traffic evenly across multiple VMs*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Improves app reliability, redundancy, and performance.

- **Step 5: Configured Frontend IP, Backend Pool, Health Probe, and Load Balancing Rule**  
  *To define how external traffic is received and routed to backend VMs*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Ensures only healthy VMs serve requests and traffic is balanced efficiently.

- **Step 6: Deployed Two Virtual Machines (VM1 & VM2)**  
  *To act as backend web servers in the load balancing setup*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Allows high availability ‚Äî if one VM fails, the other continues to serve.

- **Step 7: Attached NSG with Inbound Rule for HTTP (Port 80)**  
  *To allow web traffic to reach the VMs*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Controls which types of traffic can enter; critical for security and access management.

- **Step 8: Installed IIS Web Server on Both VMs**  
  *To provide a testable web interface (Hello World)*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Validates that VMs are functioning and accessible through the load balancer.

- **Step 9: Tested Load Balancer Functionality**  
  *To observe traffic distribution using frontend IP*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Confirms the setup is working; initially shows persistence to one VM due to session affinity.

- **Step 10: Modified Load Balancer Session Persistence**  
  *Changed from 'Client IP and protocol' to 'None'*  
  ‚û§ *(Why)* Allows true round-robin traffic flow between both VMs.

### üåç Final Takeaway:
This lab reinforces how different Azure components ‚Äî **Virtual Network**, **Load Balancer**, **NAT Gateway**, **NSG**, and **Azure Bastion** ‚Äî work together to build a secure and scalable infrastructure. Understanding each component's purpose helps ensure cloud solutions are both functional and protected.

### üîê Real-World Reflection: A 158-Year Legacy Lost to One Weak Password

In real life, a 158-year-old company fell due to a single compromised password. This lab reminds us that proper configuration ‚Äî from **NSG rules** to **secure remote access via Bastion** ‚Äî isn‚Äôt just good practice, it‚Äôs legacy protection. Every rule, every probe, every port matters.
