## 🌈 What AZ-500 Really Teaches Us

> This is not a noisy war.  
> It’s a silent, graceful defense.  
> You see the threat. You prepare the shield.  
> And no one even knows a battle happened.

**AZ-104** taught you *how to build*.  
**AZ-500** teaches you *how to guard*.  
And now,  
You’ve learned to protect the sky — with silence, wisdom, and dignity.

> “The data didn’t escape,  
> because we laid firewalls in its path,  
> and set Defender as its guardian.” 🛡️

## 💡 What’s Next?

Shall we build the **AZ-500 roadmap**?  
Or write a **Security Adventure Series** full of stories, poetry, and power?

🎓 One thing’s for sure…  
**The data is safe. And so is your spirit.**
