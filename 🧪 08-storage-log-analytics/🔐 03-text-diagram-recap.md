## 🎭 Diagram Story — With Kasper, Sofia & Mr. eks2

**Kasper:** Alright team, imagine this whole setup like a smart post office! 📦  
We started with a **Resource Group** — it’s like a neighborhood for all our Azure stuff. Neat and tidy.

**Sofia:** Yes, and putting things in a **Resource Group** [ressourcegruppe] helps us manage and clean up easily — like putting all your socks in one drawer.

**Mr. eks2:** Oh! So when we delete the drawer, the socks go too? Efficient!

---

**Kasper:** Then we built a **Storage Account** — think of it like a giant cloud warehouse. We called it **NordicStorageX**.

**Sofia:** Inside that warehouse, we created a **Blob Container** — our digital shelf! That's where we uploaded those .txt files to simulate activity.

**Mr. eks2:** Do these files just float in space until someone visits?

**Kasper:** Sort of! But that’s why we added tracking! 😄

---

**Sofia:** The magic comes from the **Log Analytics Workspace** — it’s like setting up security cameras and logs at the warehouse. You can see who came in, when, and what they touched.

**Kasper:** And we linked it up with a **Diagnostic Setting** — which is like telling the cameras what to watch for. Ours watched for blob reads, like downloading files.

**Mr. eks2:** I see… We trained the cameras to yell “He’s opening the box!”

**Sofia:** Exactly, eks2. And we queried the logs using KQL — a friendly detective’s magnifying glass. 🔍

## 🌍 Final Takeaway

This lab teaches you how to observe and trace storage activity in Azure. It’s not just about storing — it’s about visibility, tracking, and accountability. A great skill for security, compliance, and peace of mind.
