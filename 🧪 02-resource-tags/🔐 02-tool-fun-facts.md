# 🌟 Azure Tools Explained (For eks2)  
_Lab 2: Tags & Organization in Azure_

---

## 💬 After the Lab — A Cozy Catch-Up

The lab was done. Tags were applied, filters tested, and the VM was running peacefully like a happy little cloud cabin. ☁️

Mr. eks2, still holding a warm cup of tea, leaned back and smiled, “That was a great lab... but what are all these tools really for?”

🇩🇰 **Kasper** pulled up his chair with a grin, “Time for some cloud chat!”

🇪🇸 **Sofia** nodded, “Let’s break it all down. Soft and simple.”

## 🔧 Azure Tools — The Chill Explanation

### 🖥️ **Virtual Machine**

🇩🇰 **Kasper**: “Imagine a **Virtual Machine** as your own little computer floating in the sky. You don’t have to plug it in or dust it — Azure handles all that.”

🇪🇸 **Sofia**: “And you can control how secure it is. Like in this lab, we used **Windows Server 2019** — it’s stable and good for testing.”

🧑‍🚀 **Mr. eks2**: “So it’s like a guest room I can decorate and log into whenever I want?”

---

### 📦 **Resource Group**

🇩🇰 **Kasper**: “Think of the **Resource Group** (*Ressourcegruppe*) as a shoebox. You can toss in your VM, disks, tags — all in one box!”

🇪🇸 **Sofia**: “It also helps when deleting or moving stuff. You can handle the entire group at once.”

🧑‍🚀 **Mr. eks2**: “A neat, Danish storage box for all my Azure things. I love it.”

---

### 🏷️ **Tags**

🇩🇰 **Kasper**: “Now this is fun — **Tags** are like sticky notes you attach to your cloud stuff. We used ‘**Department: IT**’ in our lab. It’s like saying, ‘Hey! This belongs to Team IT.’”

🇪🇸 **Sofia**: “Tags help track billing, organize teams, and automate policies. In big companies, this small thing makes a big difference.”

🧑‍🚀 **Mr. eks2**: “I want to tag my coffee mug now: ‘Owner: eks2’.”

---

### 🔍 **Filters**

🇩🇰 **Kasper**: “Filters are like magical glasses. You pop them on, and suddenly only the things you tagged ‘**IT**’ show up. Very tidy!”

🇪🇸 **Sofia**: “Exactly. With hundreds of resources, filters help you find what matters fast — especially by **tag value**.”

🧑‍🚀 **Mr. eks2**: “Ahh, so I can zoom in on exactly what I need. I like this power!”

### 💽 **OS Disk (Standard SSD)**

🇩🇰 **Kasper**: “That’s your VM’s brain. We used a **Standard SSD** — think of it like a fast notebook. Not too fancy, not too slow.”

🇪🇸 **Sofia**: “Choosing the right disk type matters. SSDs are faster than HDDs and perfect for test labs like this.”

🧑‍🚀 **Mr. eks2**: “So my VM’s thoughts are stored in a speedy little cloud notebook? Wonderful!”
