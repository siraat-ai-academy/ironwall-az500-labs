# 🌥️ Reflections After the Lab — Eks2’s Dialogue with ShadowNet

---

### 🌥️ The Cloud Has Two Voices...

👨‍💼 **Mr. Eks2** — A kind trainee learning cloud security in Denmark, one careful step at a time.  
🕶️ **ShadowNet** — A silent adversary born from forgotten defaults and unchecked assumptions.

## 📘 Scene: After the Lab, in the Quiet Cloud

The firewall was deployed.  
The DNS was set.  
Eks2 closed the final portal and leaned back, the warm Copenhagen dusk gently fading outside his window.

His mouse hovered over “Delete Resource Group” — but something made him pause.

There, in the silence of his thoughts, it whispered — not from the code, not from the console… but from the **space between assumptions and action**.

The air grew colder. A shimmer flickered across his screen — not visual, but felt.

A shadow formed.  
It did not knock. It was always there.

**ShadowNet**:  
"You configured well today."

**Mr. Eks2** looked up, startled. Not afraid — but aware.  
> "Who are you?"

**ShadowNet**:  
"I am not a threat. I am the path *before* the threat. I am every assumption you made without pause."

**Mr. Eks2** shifted in his chair.  
> "But I followed the lab. The RDP rule was needed — for testing."

**ShadowNet**:  
"Ah. *Testing.* The most loyal friend of vulnerability. You told yourself it was temporary. You told no one else."

> "It was internal traffic. I blocked public access to the workload VM."

**ShadowNet**:  
"You opened 3389 to the world for your jump server. You didn’t restrict IPs. That rule still sits in the portal — like an unlocked door, on a quiet street, at midnight."

Mr. Eks2’s throat dried.  
He remembered the audit tab — untouched. The logs — unreviewed.

> "So what should I do?"

**ShadowNet** moved closer, yet remained fog.  
**No form. Only implication.**

**ShadowNet**:  
"Ask yourself: did you build this for clarity — or for completion?  
Did you name your rules so your future self understands them?  
Did you trust the firewall — or *verify* it with test packets and alerts?"

Mr. Eks2 sat straighter.

> "You’re not here to hack me."

**ShadowNet**:  
"No. I wait. For comfort. For fatigue. For ‘it’s just a lab.’  
You see, I don’t break in.  
**I wait for when you leave the windows cracked open.**"

## 🛡️ Threat Modelling Reflection Table

| 🔍 Security Element | 💭 Eks2’s Reflection |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| 🔓 **What was exposed** | Public **NSG rule** with broad access on port 3389 |
| ❗ **Dangerous assumption** | “It’s just for testing — I’ll delete it later.” |
| 🛠️ **How I’ll improve** | Apply **least privilege**, use **service tags**, enable **alerts**, and restrict IPs |
| 🕶️ **ShadowNet’s silent lesson** | “A threat does not break in — it enters where you never looked.” |

## 🧠 Bonus Ending Quote from ShadowNet

> “I am not a hacker.  
> I am the unchecked checkbox,  
> The rule left behind,  
> The log never read.  
> And I’m already inside —  
> because you never thought I could be.”
