# 🌸 Azure Tools Reflection — After the Firewall Lab 🔥

> A dreamy tea-circle of understanding, with the full IronWall team 🫖🌿

## 💬 A Soft Post-Lab Moment

The lab was done. The screens faded into calm blues, the hum of virtual machines quiet now. In the cozy café corner of Siraat AI Academy, the IronWall team gathered like stars at dusk — still glowing with insight.

**Mr. Eks2** sipped his chamomile tea and tilted his head.

> “The lab’s done... but can we talk about what we just used?”  

**Sofia** smiled gently. **Kasper** chuckled with a knowing nod. From the shadows, **I.K.** appeared — soft steps, clear gaze.

They began to speak — one by one — their words weaving meaning into each Azure tool used in the lab…

## 🌐 Virtual Network (VNet)

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “It’s like building a new city from scratch. Streets, districts, walls. The **Virtual Network** is the land where your cloud citizens live!”

**🇪🇸 Sofia**: “And every subnet is a neighborhood. Organize them with care — don’t mix your bakery with your data vault.”

**🇵🇰 I.K.**: “The **VNet** teaches us this: even in the cloud, boundaries matter. There is no freedom without form.”

**🇷🇺 Elina**: “I define VNets in Bicep. That way, they always rise the same — predictable, poetic.”

**🇮🇹 Isabella**: “When people don’t name subnets clearly, confusion blooms. Clarity in names is clarity in minds.”

**🇪🇸 Inky**: “If you don’t isolate your subnets? I’ll jump from one VM to another like a cat on rooftops. 🐾”

**🇨🇳 Maya Lin**: “So it’s like building invisible walls in the sky… I love it! ✨”

**👨‍💼 Mr. Eks2**: “Hmm… then I’ll call it my cloud’s skeleton. Quiet but essential.”

**🕶️ ShadowNet**: waits for default subnets left untouched, their names unchanged, their gates wide open…

## 🖥️ Virtual Machines (VMs)

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “Imagine having a tiny workstation in the cloud — your own desk floating above the earth.”

**🇪🇸 Sofia**: “We use **Jump Servers** to reduce exposure. Only one way in, and everything else stays locked.”

**🇵🇰 I.K.**: “A VM is a reflection of human responsibility — you hold the keys, and you guard the door.”

**🇷🇺 Elina**: “I spin VMs with ARM templates or Terraform. One click, full infrastructure.”

**🇮🇹 Isabella**: “But humans forget. So we set policies to protect them from their own fatigue.”

**🇪🇸 Inky**: “If your VM has RDP open to the world and no NSG? I’m already inside.”

**🇨🇳 Maya Lin**: “So we never give public IPs to sensitive VMs, right? That makes sense! 😊”

**👨‍💼 Mr. Eks2**: “They feel like quiet islands. And we choose who can dock.”

**🕶️ ShadowNet**: sniffs for ports left open, untouched alerts, passwords too easy…

## 🔥 Azure Firewall

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “This one? It’s like a wise gatekeeper standing between chaos and calm.”

**🇪🇸 Sofia**: “You build a policy. You say what’s allowed — and everything else is gently denied.”

**🇵🇰 I.K.**: “A firewall is faith. It believes in trust only when proven. All else is illusion.”

**🇷🇺 Elina**: “I manage them with IaC too — and always split **Application**, **Network**, and **DNAT** rules clearly.”

**🇮🇹 Isabella**: “Because people forget why a rule exists. So I write reasons in the description.”

**🇪🇸 Inky**: “If the rules are vague or duplicated? I slide through like mist.”

**🇨🇳 Maya Lin**: “The Application Rule was my favorite! Like saying, ‘Google may enter, but Microsoft must knock.’”

**👨‍💼 Mr. Eks2**: “A firewall… is a boundary with a soul.”

**🕶️ ShadowNet**: loves firewalls that exist — but are misconfigured, misapplied, or misnamed…

## 🧭 Route Table

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “A Route Table is like GPS for your packets. It says: ‘Go here, avoid that road.’”

**🇪🇸 Sofia**: “We always point sensitive traffic toward the firewall. That way, we don’t take the wild roads.”

**🇵🇰 I.K.**: “It is not control. It is direction. Every packet is a prayer — and this is its qibla.”

**🇷🇺 Elina**: “Automate associations — subnet + route table — it prevents drift.”

**🇮🇹 Isabella**: “When you forget to route traffic through the firewall, it’s like letting someone bypass security and enter the back door.”

**🇪🇸 Inky**: “No routing? Then your traffic walks in darkness. And I love darkness.”

**🇨🇳 Maya Lin**: “So… Route Table = Map. Got it. I’ll draw it in my notes with little clouds!”

**👨‍💼 Mr. Eks2**: “Routes are promises. Promises to protect, if kept.”

**🕶️ ShadowNet**: thrives when traffic flows free — without purpose, without paths…

## 🌐 DNS & Custom DNS Settings

**🇩🇰 Kasper**: “DNS is like your phonebook. Without it? You’re calling people by number.”

**🇪🇸 Sofia**: “Always define DNS manually if you block access. Otherwise, names don’t resolve.”

**🇵🇰 I.K.**: “Without names, the world becomes number. And in number, we lose meaning.”

**🇷🇺 Elina**: “I bake custom DNS into the VM NIC configs — with automation of course.”

**🇮🇹 Isabella**: “Users get confused when websites don’t load. DNS is invisible, but emotional.”

**🇪🇸 Inky**: “No DNS? I sniff misconfigurations and slip in while you wonder why nothing loads.”

**🇨🇳 Maya Lin**: “It’s like teaching your VM a secret directory… wow.”

**👨‍💼 Mr. Eks2**: “Every name holds power. DNS is the whisper that tells a machine what to trust.”

**🕶️ ShadowNet**: waits in the confusion — where DNS breaks and admins assume it’s the user’s fault…

## 📝 Final Reflection by Mr. Eks2

He closed his notebook softly. The pen clicked with a kind finality.

> “Today, I met tools that don’t just work — they protect.  
> Like my future content, they need boundaries, structure, and care.”  

I will write in my Danish notes:  
- **Firewall Policy** [Firewallpolitik]  
- **Virtual Network** [Virtuelt netværk]  

And beside them, a tiny drawing: a shield, a road, and a whispering cloud 🌥️

### 🔐 Real-World Reflection: A 158-Year Legacy Lost to One Weak Password

Not long ago, a 158-year-old company collapsed because of **one compromised password** — no alerts, no segmentation, no second chances. It’s a reminder that **tools like firewalls, routes, and rules** aren’t luxury — they’re legacy-keepers.
