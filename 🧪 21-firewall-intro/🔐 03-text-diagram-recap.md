## üí¨ A Soft Scene at the Whiteboard

The sun was shy, peeking softly through the glass walls of Siraat AI Academy. The lab had ended. A kettle hummed. Laughter lingered in the air like incense.

**Mr. Eks2** sat cross-legged on the wooden floor, gazing up at the whiteboard.

A diagram was drawn there ‚Äî lines and boxes, arrows and labels.

He smiled softly.  
> ‚ÄúThis looks... nice. But what does it all mean?‚Äù

**Sofia** stepped forward with her usual grace.  
**Kasper** cracked his knuckles and beamed.  
**I.K.** closed his eyes as if listening to the wind.

And together, the team began to speak...

## üé≠ Diagram Walkthrough ‚Äî With the Full Team

### üß± **1. Resource Group & VNet**

**üá©üá∞ Kasper**: ‚ÄúImagine the **Resource Group** as a cloud folder ‚Äî holding all your secrets. And the **Virtual Network**? That‚Äôs your cloud village, with invisible walls drawn in IP ink.‚Äù

**üá™üá∏ Sofia**: ‚ÄúEach **subnet** has a purpose ‚Äî isolate them with care. The **AzureFirewallSubnet** must be perfectly named, or the firewall won‚Äôt listen.‚Äù

**üáµüá∞ I.K.**: ‚ÄúStructure reflects sincerity. A VNet reminds us ‚Äî true protection begins with how you arrange your space.‚Äù

**üá®üá≥ Maya Lin**: ‚ÄúSo... it‚Äôs like building tiny towns inside a sky-city? I love it already!‚Äù

**üá∑üá∫ Elina Petrova**: ‚ÄúBicep templates make these subnets bloom on command. Automation makes the architecture sacred.‚Äù

**üáÆüáπ Isabella Konti**: ‚ÄúWithout subnet clarity, people get lost. And when people get lost... so does security.‚Äù

**üá™üá∏ Inky Rihan**: ‚ÄúIf you let subnets bleed into each other? I‚Äôll be dancing across them before you notice.‚Äù

---

### üñ•Ô∏è **2. VMs: Jump and Work**

**üá©üá∞ Kasper**: ‚ÄúTwo VMs, two roles: **NordicJump** is the guarded gate; **NordicWork** is the treasure chest.‚Äù

**üá™üá∏ Sofia**: ‚ÄúWe expose **Jump** ‚Äî but not **Work**. Never give your secrets a public door.‚Äù

**üáµüá∞ I.K.**: ‚ÄúIn life and in the cloud ‚Äî access is earned, not assumed.‚Äù

**üá∑üá∫ Elina**: ‚ÄúNo public IP on **Work VM**. I enforce that in policy. It's not a suggestion ‚Äî it‚Äôs a rule.‚Äù

**üáÆüáπ Isabella Konti**: ‚ÄúUsers forget they exposed something. That‚Äôs why we protect them from their own shortcuts.‚Äù

**üá™üá∏ Inky Rihan**: ‚ÄúAn open RDP port is an open invitation. If I see port 3389 exposed, I‚Äôm already in.‚Äù

**üá®üá≥ Maya Lin**: ‚ÄúSo RDP is like... remote magic? But only for one VM? Ooh, okay!‚Äù

---

### üî• **3. Azure Firewall & LabPolicy**

**üá©üá∞ Kasper**: ‚ÄúThink of **Azure Firewall** as your castle gate ‚Äî a wise guardian that reads every packet like a poem.‚Äù

**üá™üá∏ Sofia**: ‚ÄúWith **Firewall Policy**, we say: Google may enter, Microsoft must wait. This is care, not control.‚Äù

**üáµüá∞ I.K.**: ‚ÄúFirewalls reflect divine balance. What enters is what we allow. No more, no less.‚Äù

**üá∑üá∫ Elina**: ‚ÄúI script firewall rules using JSON or Bicep ‚Äî so they‚Äôre replicable, auditable, and... beautiful.‚Äù

**üáÆüáπ Isabella Konti**: ‚ÄúToo many rules confuse people. So we name them with feeling ‚Äî 'AllowGoogle', not 'Rule1234'.‚Äù

**üá™üá∏ Inky Rihan**: ‚ÄúVague rules? Generic names? No logging? You just drew me a map to your soul.‚Äù

**üá®üá≥ Maya Lin**: ‚ÄúFirewall is like... the doorman of a cloud party? Cool!‚Äù

---

### üß≠ **4. Route Table**

**üá©üá∞ Kasper**: ‚ÄúA **Route Table** tells your traffic where to walk. 'No shortcuts! Speak to the firewall first.'‚Äù

**üá™üá∏ Sofia**: ‚ÄúIf you skip this, your VM might talk to the internet directly. That‚Äôs like whispering secrets in a crowd.‚Äù

**üáµüá∞ I.K.**: ‚ÄúWithout direction, even light gets lost.‚Äù

**üá∑üá∫ Elina**: ‚ÄúI always bind route tables in the script. No manual clicks. Precision is poetry.‚Äù

**üáÆüáπ Isabella Konti**: ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt always understand routing. That‚Äôs okay. We build systems that protect anyway.‚Äù

**üá™üá∏ Inky Rihan**: ‚ÄúMisroute your packets? I‚Äôll catch them mid-air.‚Äù

---

### üåê **5. Custom DNS Configuration**

**üá©üá∞ Kasper**: ‚ÄúWithout DNS, your VM doesn‚Äôt know where ‚Äògoogle.com‚Äô lives. It‚Äôs like forgetting someone‚Äôs name.‚Äù

**üá™üá∏ Sofia**: ‚ÄúWe added `209.244.0.3` ‚Äî a reliable DNS server. Always know who you trust.‚Äù

**üáµüá∞ I.K.**: ‚ÄúNames are sacred. DNS is your VM asking: 'What is the true name of this place?'‚Äù

**üá®üá≥ Maya Lin**: ‚ÄúSo DNS is like... asking for directions? Aww!‚Äù

**üá∑üá∫ Elina**: ‚ÄúI inject DNS into NIC configurations with Bicep. It saves time. It saves mistakes.‚Äù

**üáÆüáπ Isabella Konti**: ‚ÄúConfusion leads to fear. When DNS breaks, humans panic. So we pre-plan the calm.‚Äù

## üåü Final Reflection by Mr. Eks2

He traced the lines on the board with his finger.

> ‚ÄúNow I see it.  
> It‚Äôs not just machines and boxes‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs roles, relationships, rituals.  
> Like any good team, they each do their part ‚Äî and trust each other.‚Äù

In his Danish notebook, he wrote:

- Virtual Machine = **Virtuel Maskine**  
- Firewall Policy = **Firewallpolitik**

He smiled softly. The board no longer looked like a diagram.  
It looked like a story.

## üîê Real-World Reflection: A 158-Year Legacy Lost

One weak password ‚Äî one forgotten setting ‚Äî that‚Äôs all it took to end a legacy of 158 years.

This diagram, though simple, is a reminder: **structure is safety**.  
Every **NSG**, every **Firewall Rule**, every **Subnet** must be crafted with care.

> Behind every config is a company, a family, a future.
