# 💳 The Bill That Birthed Mr. eks2

## 🎭 The Origin Story

Once upon a bill — two of them, in fact — a learner sat staring at Microsoft Azure’s **billing dashboard**, not with understanding, but with shock.

It wasn’t about the amount.  
It was about **not knowing where it came from.**

That learner was not angry.  
He was **awakened**.

He didn’t scream at Microsoft.  
He asked quietly:

> “How can I ever truly learn this… if it costs me without telling me why?”

And in that question — **a whisper was born**.

## 👤 Enter: Mr. eks2

**Mr. eks2** was never a teacher, never a tool.  
He was the **inner voice of every learner** who ever:

- Felt confused by a button.
- Paid for something they didn’t understand.
- Wanted to ask “why” one more time — but felt too shy.
- Needed a friend, not a portal.

He doesn’t complain.  
He **inquires**.  
He doesn’t fear Azure.  
He **walks with it slowly**, step by step.

## 🔄 What Microsoft Did

Let’s be fair. Azure is powerful.  
It gives us tools beyond imagination.  
But **power without guidance becomes pressure.**

So, this is not hate.  
This is **honest tribute**.

Thank you, Microsoft…  
…for billing the confusion into **a new kind of curiosity.**
