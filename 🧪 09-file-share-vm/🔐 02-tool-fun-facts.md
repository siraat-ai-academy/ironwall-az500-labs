# 🧰 Azure Tools from Lab 9 — For Mr. eks2

> _“That was a great lab... but what are all these tools really for?”_  
Mr. eks2 leans back in his chair after a long, curious day in the lab. Kasper pours coffee. Sofia brings soft Danish cookies. And the real fun begins — explaining each Azure tool, one bite at a time 🍪☕.

## 🔧 What We Used in Lab 9 — One Tool at a Time

### ☁️ **Azure Storage Account**

**Kasper**: "Imagine a giant, invisible warehouse in the cloud. That’s the **Storage Account**. It’s where we keep all the stuff — files, logs, photos, maybe even my secret recipe folder."

**Sofia**: “And this warehouse needs protection. So Azure helps us secure it using permissions, encryption, and diagnostic settings. Also — always pick the right redundancy setting!”

**Mr. eks2**: “So... it's like a digital basement, but safer and always dry?”

---

### 📁 **File Share**

**Kasper**: “Ah yes, the **File Share**! Think of it like a shared folder in the cloud that your whole office can reach. No USB sticks, no email chains. Just mount and go!”

**Sofia**: “And it uses **SMB**, a protocol that’s very popular in offices. It’s encrypted by default when going over the internet — but still, be careful with access controls.”

**Mr. eks2**: “I like this! No more passing files like folded notes in class.”

---

### 🖥️ **Virtual Machine (VM)**

**Kasper**: “This is your computer in the cloud! Like a rental PC. You only pay when it’s running. We used a Windows Server VM here — a pretty standard guest.”

**Sofia**: “And don’t forget the security part — open only needed ports, and always monitor who logs in. No one likes surprise guests on their VM.”

**Mr. eks2**: “Can I name my VM ‘Kasper’s Cloud Castle’ next time?”

---

### 🔐 **Snapshots**

**Kasper**: “Ah, **Snapshots** — it’s like pressing ‘pause’ on a file’s life. You can always go back. Very handy when someone accidentally deletes ‘FinalVersion_RealFinal2.txt’.”

**Sofia**: “They’re useful for fast restores, but watch your costs. Each snapshot uses storage.”

**Mr. eks2**: “So... like a time machine, but only for files? I love this.”

---

### 📄 **Previous Versions (on VM)**

**Kasper**: “Windows keeps some magic too! If you mess up a file inside the VM, you can go back to an older version — right-click, and boom — file rewind!”

**Sofia**: “Yes, it depends on how your VM is set up. Backups, file versioning, all matter. It’s always nice to have a second chance.”

**Mr. eks2**: “I wish I had this for some emails I sent last year... 😅”
