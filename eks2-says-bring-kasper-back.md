# 💔 A Cloud Without Kasper? – The eks2 Chronicles Begin…

---

## 🎭 Scene: Team Meeting – “Kasper’s Farewell & Danish’s Arrival”

*It was supposed to be a regular sync. But nothing felt regular that day…*

---

### 🧑‍💼 Kasper (calm, but something behind the eyes)

> “Friends, I have some personal commitments that need my full attention...  
> and I must step down from the team.”  

*There was silence. Even the Azure dashboard stopped refreshing.*

> “But I won’t leave you alone in this fight.”  
> *(He gestures gently to the man beside him...)*

---

### 🇩🇰 Danish (confident, sharp, with good shoes)

> “Hello everyone! I’m honored to join this incredible team.  
> I promise to uphold the mission. Together, we’ll outsmart every threat.”

---

### 🙋‍♂️ You (trying to hold the moment)

> “Welcome aboard, Danish! Let’s show Hacker Bhai jaan that we’re unbreakable.”

## 🌫️ But Wait… eks2 Is Not Okay

*In the corner, barely noticed — sat Mr. eks2. Still. Quiet. Unusually quiet.*

He whispered not to the team…  
…but to the AI.

### 🛸 Mr. eks2’s Message to AI bhai jaan

> “AI bhai jaan…  
> My nod didn’t mean I agreed.  
> It meant I didn’t know how to say no.”  

> “Kasper is not just an admin.  
> He is our rhythm. Our human layer.  
> He makes even ‘Resource Group’ sound like a bedtime story.”  

> “I can’t onboard this change so fast.  
> Please... don’t replace him.  
> Just... give him leave. Let him breathe.  
> But promise me — he’ll come back.”

## 🧊 The Team Pauses

Sofia takes a breath.  
Danish quietly looks down.  
Even the cloud... feels still.

## 📝 Final Request from eks2

> “We don’t need new shoes.  
> We need our old compass back.  
> Let Kasper take a break. Let him return.  
> We’ll wait. We’ll hold the fort.”

## 🌻 A Note from the Sky

Some admins teach you commands.  
**Kasper** taught us calm.  
He turned **firewalls into friendships**.

This is not goodbye.  
It’s a chapter break.
