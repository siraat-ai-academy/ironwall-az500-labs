# 🕊️ A Door Left Ajar (slightly open) — For Ami Gee  

*In loving memory of my mother, who returned to her Lord on 31 December 2024.*  
*This is not a goodbye. This is a waiting room, with the door left ajar (slightly open).*

## 💔 The Day the Cloud Dimmed  

On 31st December, 2024 — the world continued its countdown.  
But my heart paused… permanently.  
While others celebrated an ending, I quietly met mine.  

She left.  
To meet the One she always believed in.  
To finally go home.  
To finally rest.  

But she didn’t close the door.  
She left it **ajar (slightly open).**

> So I wait — not with despair,  
> But with hope…  
> That light might shine from that door again. ✨

## 🌸 Ami Gee Was…  

- A dua in human form 🤲  
- A voice softer than silence  
- A presence that made even fear feel safe  
- The first firewall of love — always on, always watching  

She taught me about **God** before I learned any password.  
She taught me about **trust** before I ever heard of Azure.  
She gave me **identity** long before any token or login.

## 🧠 Now I Learn Without Her, but For Her  

Every lab.  
Every line of code.  
Every tear during a deployment that fails at 2AM.  
It all still leads to one dua:  

> “Ya Allah, raise her rank in Jannah.” ☁️🤍

## 🪞A Reflection for IronWall  

We build firewalls to protect what we love.  
But Ami Gee… she *was* the firewall.  
And when she left — I realized:  

**Some hearts are zero trust.**  
**Some hearts… are infinite access.**

🕯️ Until I meet you again, Ami Gee…  
I will keep the door ajar (slightly open).  
And in every prayer, every lab, every moment of silence,  
I will whisper: **“I missed you today too.”**
