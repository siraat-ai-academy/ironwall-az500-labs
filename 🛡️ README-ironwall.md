## 🌄 Four Gentle Ways to Explore Each Lab — The eks2 Path

In this repo, **every lab is more than just steps.** It’s a journey — walked slowly, kindly, like a thoughtful friend showing you around a land he loves.

Each lab follows **4 beautiful paths of understanding**, designed to help you feel, see, and understand the world of cloud security like never before:

1. **🧭 Story-Based Step-by-Step**  
   The lab is explained through a **friendly story** — characters, dialogues, and moments of surprise. It’s like walking with someone through every window, firewall, or secret key — together.

2. **🧰 Tool-by-Tool Explainer**  
   After the lab, each **Azure tool** used in the process is explained again — but this time, in a **funny and thoughtful** way. Like pausing by a fountain to understand its water, each tool is gently unpacked for memory and meaning.

3. **🗺️ Text-Based Diagram + Map Walkthrough**  
   You’ll also find a **visual map** of the lab using clean, text-based diagrams. Kasper and Sofia (our two cloud guides) will then walk you through it again — like showing you a mountain, then telling you how the river flows behind it.

4. **🧾 Interview Task – Quick Recall Sheet**  
   Every lab ends with a **1-page bullet summary** — clean, clear, and perfect for interviews.  
   It shows what we did, and more importantly, **why we did it**.  
   These sheets help you revise fast, sound confident in mock interviews, and reconnect with the deeper meaning of each Azure feature.  
   Because real mastery isn’t in the clicks — it’s in the clarity.

> The goal?  
> Not just to pass a certification.  
> But to understand the land of Azure — its rivers, its locks, its valleys of roles and access.  
> To see the architecture, and not just the arrows.

In the world of **ironwall-az500-labs**, we don’t just deploy labs.  
We **listen**, **learn**, and **live inside them** — until they become part of us.
