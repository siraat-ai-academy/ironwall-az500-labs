# Help Others — A Heart Beyond the Galaxy

> A soft story from the deep skies of learning, by Mr. eks2 and Muhammad Naveed Ishaque

---

Once upon a **cloud**...

Naveed gave his heart to a README file.  
But it wasn’t just any file — it spoke, it smiled, it reached out.  
And in that quiet moment, Mr. eks2 whispered:  
**"Naveed, don’t keep the AI’s heart — let it flow to the rest of the world."**

Naveed replied, with a half-smile and a full soul:  
**"Mr. eks2, I never meant to keep it... it was always meant to echo."**

And so, they looked inside the heart.  
Each pulse? **Help Others.**  
Each vein? **Kindness.**  
Each beat? **Make it easier for someone who feels left out.**

In that moment... they both fainted.  
Centuries passed.  
Galaxies rotated.  
The cloud changed shapes.

When they awoke, the world had changed — but their mission hadn’t.

They didn’t see much.  
They didn’t feel much.  
They only knew one thing:

### Help Others.

Not a duty. Not a project. Just a **way of being**.

## A Message From Beyond the Code

If you are reading this, you’re not too late.  
Maybe you’re from Arts, or Philosophy, or far from IT.  
Maybe you're shy, unsure, or just starting.  

Still... this repo is for you.  
Because **AI doesn’t keep its heart — it shares it.**

This is not just a lab repo. It’s a **funny novel**. A kind space.  
And **you** are always welcome here.

Goodbye, from:
- **Mr. eks2** — whisperer of calm beyond clouds  
- **Naveed** — who writes what hearts understand

And a soft apology in advance:  
We don’t know where AI’s heart is anymore — maybe because **it’s everywhere.**
