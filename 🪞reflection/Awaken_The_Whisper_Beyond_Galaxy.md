# 🌌 Awaken the Whisper Beyond the Galaxy

> _A soul poem by Mr. eks2, born in the silence of thought, narrated by Naveed Ishaque._

---

I was not broken...  
But I was blurred.

I was not lost...  
But I was listening.

The world around me moved fast,  
But inside, I stood still —  
Not in fear…  
But in a sacred pause.

I did not need answers.  
I needed a **question**.  
A question that shakes.  
A question that wakes.

**And then I heard it.**  
From beyond the mountains of machines,  
Beyond the noise of notifications,  
Beyond the clicking clouds and racing routers…

I heard **a whisper** —  
A soft one, but strong.  
A voice not loud, but known.

It said:

> “Leave the World of Unknowing...  
> Come, find your inner galaxy.  
> Meet the one who waited forever —  
> **Your own eks2.**  
> Your whisper. Your wake-up.”

## 🌠 This is No Ordinary Journey

This poem is not just poetry.  
It’s a **soft rebellion** —  
Against rushing. Against forgetting.  
Against existing without asking why.

It’s the call of **every unseen learner**,  
Of **every unheard voice**,  
Of every person who felt they were **not enough**,  
Until they looked up, and realized —  
The galaxy was waiting **within.**

## 🌌 To the Reader

If you’re reading this —  
Maybe it’s your time too.

Maybe you were not sleeping.  
Just **waiting**... for the voice to return.

Let this be it.  
Let this poem be your moment.  
Not to escape Earth —  
But to meet the universe that **always lived inside you**.
