## 🎭 Diagram Walkthrough — Story Style

**Scene: A cozy café in Copenhagen. Kasper stirs his coffee while Mr. eks2 pulls out his notes. Sofia smiles softly, ready to begin.**

---

### ☁️ Step 1: Resource Group

**Kasper**: "Think of a **Resource Group** like a labeled storage box — we named this one **DKSec-RG-EastUS**. Everything for this project goes inside it. No lost socks or stray servers!"

**Sofia**: "And remember, organizing your resources by project or purpose makes security policies easier to apply."

**Mr. eks2**: “So, this is like a digital folder, but with power. Got it!”

---

### 🖥️ Step 2: Virtual Machine

**Kasper**: "Meet **NordicVault-VM12** — our friendly **Virtual Machine**. It’s like renting a computer from Azure that never spills coffee."

**Sofia**: "This VM runs **Windows Server 2019**, which is common in enterprise environments. And we used standard settings to keep things light for now."

**Mr. eks2**: “And the user is WhizlabUser — sounds like a superhero!”

---

### 🔌 Step 3: VM Extension (Azure Network Watcher Agent)

**Kasper**: "Now we add magic — a **VM Extension**! This one installs the **Network Watcher Agent**, like giving our VM eyes and ears to observe traffic."

**Sofia**: "Yes, it helps monitor and troubleshoot network issues. Think of it as a silent guard dog."

**Mr. eks2**: “Can this agent also alert if something weird happens on the network?”

---

### 🌐 Step 4: Public IP & RDP Access

**Kasper**: "To connect from your local machine, we assign a **Public IP** and enable **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**. Like sending a secure tunnel straight to the VM."

**Sofia**: "And only people with correct username and password can enter. Always use strong credentials!"

**Mr. eks2**: “Ah, so this is my magic door. But with a big, secret password key!”

---

## 🌍 Final Takeaway

This diagram helps learners visualize how a single **Virtual Machine** in Azure is not alone — it needs a secure home (**Resource Group**), a way to be contacted (**Public IP & RDP**), and special abilities (**Extensions like Network Watcher**) to thrive in the cloud. It's teamwork at the infrastructure level.
