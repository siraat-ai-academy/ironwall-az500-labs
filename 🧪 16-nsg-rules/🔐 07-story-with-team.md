## 📖 The Story Begins — *The Machine and the Gate*

In the West Europe datacenter, clouds gathered not in the sky, but in Azure.

**👨‍💼 Mr. Eks2** walked into the command deck of IronWall’s secure zone, his eyes scanning the interface like a seasoned poet reading an unfamiliar script.

"Why no public ports this time?" he murmured, more to himself than to the team.

**🇩🇰 Kasper Madsen** appeared beside him, as if summoned by thought. “Because, dear Eks2, silence is the first firewall. We begin with no doors — then we decide which to open, and why.”

And thus, **myVM1** was born — a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine standing quietly in the mist of West Europe. No open ports. No exposure. Just potential.

## 🧩 Scene Two — *The Whispering Gate of RDP*

It was **Ayla** who first noticed it — “He needs to go in,” she said quietly, pointing at the VM's interface.

**Sofia** nodded. “Then we allow it — one precise rule, and no more.”

And so, in Azure's Networking tab, they opened a narrow, deliberate path:  
🔓 Inbound Rule: Port 3389 for RDP — tagged from Internet, action set to Allow.

“Call it **myport_3389**,” said **Eks2**, “but let it be a whisper, not a shout.”

Kasper placed his hand on the screen. “Like a window you crack open in a storm — just enough to let in breath, not chaos.”

## 🖥️ Scene Three — *Touching the Machine*

Through the RDP tunnel, **Eks2** entered the VM.

He looked around the server’s clean interface like a guest stepping into a holy chamber.

He turned to the team, voice soft. “It’s quiet here. Like a temple waiting for a song.”

“Then let’s give it voice,” smiled **Sofia**.

---

## ⚙️ Scene Four — *IIS and the First Song*

Inside the virtual machine, **Server Manager** bloomed open.

One by one, they added features — until the Web Server (IIS) stood installed.

Opening Microsoft Edge, they typed: `http://localhost`

And then, the screen responded:  
> “Welcome”

It wasn’t just a default page.  
It was a heartbeat.

---

## 🔓 Scene Five — *The HTTP Gate Opens*

**Inki**, watching logs quietly, leaned forward.

“There’s no way for the outside to hear the song,” he whispered.

“Then we create another gate,” said **Eks2**, now smiling. “This one... for the world.”

Another rule. Another whisper.  
Port 80. HTTP. Priority 110. Name: **myport_80**

“Only what is meant to be seen shall be seen,” murmured **Kasper**.

---

## 🕸️ Scene Six — *ShadowNet Stirs*

Far in the background of Azure logs...  
...something stirred.

A faint denial attempt. An unsolicited ping on port 445.  
Blocked.

**Inki’s** eyes narrowed.

“The ShadowNet is watching,” he said softly. “We opened the right doors. But it sniffs around the closed ones.”

“Let it watch,” **Sofia** replied. “We are light. Let them taste nothing but firewalls.”

## 🌍 Scene Seven — *The Final Test*

The public IP was copied.

They opened their own browsers. Typed it in.

`http://<public-ip>`

And the web page opened — proud, pure, and protected.

---

## 🌅 Ending — *Eks2 Reflects*

As the team packed up, **Mr. Eks2** stayed back a moment longer, gazing at the quiet VM interface.

“You know...” he said slowly, “a network is a reflection of the self.”

“Every port we open,” he continued, “every rule we write — is a statement of trust.”

“And every silence... a lesson in restraint.”

**Kasper** smiled. “And so it is, my friend. A firewalled heart knows which voices to let in.”

---

Eks2 didn’t just complete a lab —  
he walked a new path of wisdom, protection, and peace.

And you — yes, *you* — brought it to life with vision.
