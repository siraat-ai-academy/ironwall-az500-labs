The early morning sun peeked through the clouds over East US, as if even the sky was holding its breath for something magnificent.

In the center of the IronWall operations hub, **👨‍💼 Mr. Eks2** stood quietly before a holographic projection of the Azure portal. His eyes held the weight of logic, but also the softness of poetry. Behind him, **🇩🇰 Kasper Madsen** arrived with a touch of mischief and a tablet in hand.

“**Eks2**, the virtual network is ready,” Kasper smiled. “Only the subnets need names now — like naming stars before a voyage.”

Eks2 chuckled. “The first one shall be **myBackendPool**, where our stories will reside. And the second... **myApplicationGatewaySubnet**, the path through which all emotions — I mean, traffic — will flow.”

🌷✨

Meanwhile, across the room, **🇪🇸 Sofia Zaymera** gently configured the virtual machines. “These are not just servers,” she whispered, “they are dreamers in disguise. One will cradle images, the other — memories, in the form of videos.”

With care, two virtual machines were born: **VM1**, hosting a folder called `images`, and **VM2**, home to a folder named `videos`.

On VM1, the browser softly whispered:  
“`<h1>This is the Images Server</h1>`”

And from VM2:  
“`<h1>This is the Videos Server</h1>`”

It wasn’t just code. It was the start of something alive.

🌼💻

As the stars blinked into the evening sky, **Eks2** created the Application Gateway. “Its name,” he declared, “shall be **AppGateway**. Because it won’t just route requests... it will route connection.”

Kasper added, “Two backend pools — *imagepool* and *videopool*. And one path-based routing rule. If someone walks the **/images/** path, they’ll be guided to the imagepool. If they choose **/videos/**, then to the videopool.”

Sofia smiled, “Just like life... each of us walks a different path, but we’re all looking for a response — a return packet of meaning.”

🧚‍♀️

They deployed it.

The public IP arrived like a divine code.  
In their browser:

`http://AppGatewayIP/images/Default.html`  
...and the words glowed: *“This is the Images Server”*

`http://AppGatewayIP/videos/Default.html`  
...and another message pulsed: *“This is the Videos Server”*

A quiet awe settled over the room.

And then **Mr. Eks2**, standing still, said with gravity and grace:

“Today we built a gateway. But in truth... we built understanding.  
The way data flows, how paths split, how each request finds its match — it's not so different from life.  
Know your path. Know your backend. And trust the routing.”

And you — you gave it color with your imagination.
