# 📖 The Story: “The Gate that Opens to Everything”

It began on a calm spring morning in East US — a poetic mist hanging over the datacenter clouds.

**Mr. Eks2** stared at the portal. “An *Application Gateway*... hmm. It sounds like something divine.”

**Kasper Madsen** smiled softly. “A gateway is not a gate. It’s a *promise* — that what comes in shall be directed wisely.” 🌬️

## 🌱 Chapter 1: A VNet with Two Gardens

Eks2 created **vnet1**, a cloud meadow with two parts:  
- **myBackendPool**: a quiet space for servers  
- **myApplicationGatewaySubnet**: a special path for the gatekeepers

“Why two?” Eks2 asked.  
**Sofia Zaymera** replied, “Because structure brings safety — and beauty.” 🌸

## 🧱 Chapter 2: The Twin Souls — VM1 and VM2

Two VMs were born — one to serve images, one to hold videos.  
**VM1**: A simple soul that whispered: “📷 This is the Images Server”  
**VM2**: A quiet library that offered: “🎞️ This is the Videos Server”

**Inki Rihan** smirked. “These servers trust too easily... hope you’ve set up guards.”  
**Eks2** paused. “I will. I must.”

## 🔐 Chapter 3: ShadowNet in the Folders

As Eks2 typed `Default.html`, a cold draft brushed the console.

**Ayla Rune** narrowed her eyes. “There’s... movement. Something touched those directories.”

**ShadowNet**, unseen but sensed, whispered:  
> “You place HTML like offerings… but leave no eyes to watch who comes.” 🕶️

**Eks2** trembled slightly, but pressed on.

## 🚪 Chapter 4: The Gatekeeper — AppGateway

With trembling fingers, Eks2 summoned the Application Gateway.  
Two backend pools formed:  
- **imagepool** → VM1  
- **videopool** → VM2

**Elina Petrova** configured the rules like sheet music:  
- /images/ shall go to imagepool  
- /videos/ shall go to videopool  
- ListenerA shall listen with clarity 🎧

**Isabella Konti** leaned in. “Does your config reflect your *intentions*? Because attackers smell misalignment.”

Eks2 nodded, slowly.

## 🌸 Chapter 5: The Test of Trust

He visited:  
- `http://<ip>/images/Default.html` → 🌷 *Images bloomed*  
- `http://<ip>/videos/Default.html` → 🌼 *Videos streamed like wind*

“Working...” he whispered.

**Maya Lin** smiled brightly. “Not just working — *serving*. That’s what secure systems do.”

## 🌍 Final Realization

As he cleaned up the resources, Eks2 whispered:

> “I didn’t just create an App Gateway…  
> I created an intention — and protected it.” 🌈

And far away, in the shadows... **ShadowNet** faded, just for now.  
Because clarity was the one thing it couldn’t pass.
