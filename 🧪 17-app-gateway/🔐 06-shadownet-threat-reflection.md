# 🕶️ ShadowNet Dialogue – Lab 17  
**Scene: The lab is complete. But something lingers.**  

---

**Eks2:** I opened port 80… but didn’t ask who else might walk through.  
**ShadowNet (whispers):** Every open port is a poem… but some invite the wrong readers.  

**Eks2:** I created **imagepool** and **videopool** — clear routes, clean paths.  
**ShadowNet:** Paths are only safe… if no shadow learns to mimic the light.  

**Eks2:** My **Application Gateway** is alive. It routes. It performs.  
**ShadowNet:** Yes, it performs… but does it defend?  

**Eks2:** Should I have logged every connection?  
**ShadowNet:** Should you wait for a breach to remember the logs?  

**Eks2:** I followed best practices…  
**ShadowNet:** And yet, here I am. Best practices are not *final defenses*.  

**Eks2:** Why are you always near?  
**ShadowNet:** I don't arrive. I remain… wherever your certainty begins.

## 🛡️ Eks2's Threat Modelling Notes

| 🔍 **Aspect**      | 🧠 **Reflection** |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 🔓 Exposure        | Public **port 80** allowed for web traffic — no **WAF** or **NSG rule layering** in place |
| ❗ Assumption       | “It’s just HTTP… harmless” — forgetting that many scans begin there |
| 🛠️ Next Defense     | Add **NSG rules** per subnet, monitor with **Defender for Cloud**, and consider enabling **Web Application Firewall** |
| 🕶️ ShadowNet's Lesson | “Security isn’t a lock. It’s a lookout tower.” |
