🎬 Desired Output Format:
1. 🌟 “Meet the Minds Behind the Mission”  
   A short table/section introducing all main characters (just 1-liner each), like a movie opening scene.

2. 📖 The Story Itself  
   Convert the lab steps into a multi-part imaginative story — using:  
   o Bold names of each character when they speak or act  
   o Emotional depth, humor, and small twists  
   o Security wisdom woven into dialogues  
   o Natural transitions (like scene changes) using headers  

3. 💬 Style & Tone  
   o Friendly, cinematic, slightly poetic  
   o Use rich, soulful dialogues and gentle learning moments  
   o Include quotes, cultural insights, emotional triggers (fear, trust, joy)  

4. 🔐 Inject ShadowNet  
   Somewhere in the story, introduce a threat or anomaly connected to the lab concept — seen or sensed by ShadowNet.

5. 🌍 End With Realization  
   Eks2 reflects what he learned not just technically — but as a person growing in clarity, responsibility, and cloud wisdom.

💡 Notes for the AI:  
• Treat the lab steps as scenes in the story.  
• Each step = one scene with characters and reflection.  
• Use Danish cultural references, if appropriate.  
• Use light Urdu/Spanish phrases only if naturally flowing through character voice.  
• Eks2 is curious and asks “why.”  
• Kasper explains like a Sufi with tech metaphors.  
• Sofia simplifies with warmth and quiet depth.  
• Let ShadowNet appear in small scary moments — maybe in logs, alerts, or missed config.
