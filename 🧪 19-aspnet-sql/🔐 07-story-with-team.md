## 🌅 Scene 1: The Beginning

**Mr. eks2** stood in the quiet corner of the IronWall Labs office, watching snow fall gently outside the Copenhagen window. Visual Studio flickered open in front of him. The sample app was loaded, the `sln` file ready.

> “It’s just a to-do list,” he whispered.

**Kasper**, passing behind him with a thermos of strong Danish coffee, leaned in.  
**"Yes. But even lists can leak, eks2. Especially if they live in the cloud."**

---

## 🧩 Scene 2: Building the Cloud Bridge

He pressed `F5`. The app came to life. Simple UI. “Create New Task.”

> *Add. Test. Delete. Repeat.*

Publishing to Azure was smooth.  
The App Service deployed, the hosting plan selected (B1 tier, East US 2), the App URL birthed into the world.

**Maya Lin** peeked in from her own screen.  
**“Do you name your app like a poem?”**  
**Eks2 smiled.** “I named it *GentleTodo*.”

---

## 🗃️ Scene 3: Giving Memory to the App

“Now,” said **Sofia**, appearing like a warm breath of clarity,  
**“You must give it a mind — a database to remember what it creates.”**

Eks2 walked through the Service Dependencies, creating the Azure SQL Database, entering his credentials slowly, carefully.  
The connection string: `MyDbConnection`.

> “Why do we store it in App Settings?” he asked.

**Sofia smiled softly.** “So the mind is connected to the heart — but securely.”

---

## 🔁 Scene 4: Code, Done, and Dust

Adding the new `Done` property felt satisfying. Like a checkbox in his own learning.  
```csharp
public bool Done { get; set; }
```

He opened Package Manager Console:

```
Enable-Migrations  
Add-Migration AddProperty  
Update-Database
```

Then adjusted the views to include the checkbox.

> “This is how code becomes consciousness,” whispered **I.K.** from the hallway.

---

## 🔒 Scene 5: Publish and Reflect

The app was deployed again — now smarter.

It remembered. It displayed. It updated.

**Isabella** watched from her screen.  
**“Did you secure your memory? The DB?”**

**Eks2 nodded** — “I added my IP to the firewall.”

**She leaned in.** “Did you remove the *Allow All* rule after testing?”

Eks2 paused. Clicked.  
There it was. Still active. Wide open.

---

## 🕶️ Scene 6: When Silence Speaks

Suddenly, the Output window shifted.  
An unexpected request. A query from an unknown IP. Just one.

**“I didn’t trigger that…”**

From the reflection of the screen, **he saw the silhouette** — dark, quiet, unmoving.

🕶️ **ShadowNet.**

> “I do not force entry,” it whispered.  
> “I wait… in assumptions.”

Eks2 deleted the NSG rule. The anomaly faded.

---

## 💬 Scene 7: The Gentle Ending

The lab was complete. The to-do app live, secure, memory-backed, monitored.

But the real migration wasn’t in Azure — it was in Eks2’s awareness.

He sipped warm chai brewed by **Kasper**, and said:

> “Every lab makes me feel more… responsible.”

## 🌱 Eks2’s Realization

What I learned:

✅ Deploying is easy. Protecting is harder.  
✅ "Testing mode" can become "forgotten mode."  
✅ Every setting tells a story — if we listen.  
✅ ShadowNet is not a hacker. It is our reflection, misconfigured.
