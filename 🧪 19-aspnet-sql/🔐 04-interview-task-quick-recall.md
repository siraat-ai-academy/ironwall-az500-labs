# Interview Task – Quick Recall Sheet (Lab 19 – Deploy an ASP.NET App with Azure SQL Database) ✨

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Downloaded and Extracted the Sample App  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen:**  
"Like unpacking a starter LEGO set — all the pieces are there, waiting to be clicked together!" 🧱  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera:**  
"This gives us a working app to test locally before cloud deployment — always verify your base."  
😇 **Maya Lin:**  
“Ohh! So I get to play with a ready-made app before I send it to the cloud? That feels safe!”  

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Ran the ASP.NET App Locally  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen:**  
"Pressing F5 is like breathing life into your app for the first time — poof, it walks!"  
🧠 **I.K.:**  
"We test in stillness before we launch into the storm. Every local run is a sacred rehearsal."  
🌷 **Isabella Konti:**  
"Local testing builds confidence — both in the app and in the hands creating it."

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Published the App to Azure App Service  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen:**  
"App Service is like Airbnb for your app — you give it a key, and Azure furnishes the home."  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera:**  
"Choose the right plan size — B1 is good for demos. And always deploy to a known **Resource Group**."  
👁️ **Inky Rihan:**  
"If you skip configuration and leave default ports, I walk right in."  
🌼 **Maya Lin:**  
"Wow… it’s really alive online now?! That’s magic!"

---

## 🛠️ Step 4: Created Azure SQL Database and SQL Server  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen:**  
"This is your app’s long-term memory — a polite librarian that keeps every to-do safely stacked."  
🧠 **I.K.:**  
"Your database is a sacred scroll. Handle credentials like scripture — never casually."  
👩‍💻 **Elina Petrova:**  
"I always declare SQL servers in Bicep. Makes it traceable and versioned."  
🌷 **Isabella Konti:**  
"Human error often lies in rushed setup — so we pause before creating database roots."

---

## 🛠️ Step 5: Configured Database Connection  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera:**  
"Connection strings are your app’s secret handshake with the database. Secure it inside **App Settings**."  
🧠 **I.K.:**  
"Secrets whispered must remain unheard by others. Store with intention."  
👁️ **Inky Rihan:**  
"Expose that connection string in code, and I’ll have your data in minutes."  
😇 **Maya Lin:**  
"So Azure hides my password like a diary lock? That’s really kind!"

---

## 🛠️ Step 6: Deployed the App & Tested Online  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen:**  
"Click publish — and there it is! Your todo app running on Azure like a digital bakery open for business."  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera:**  
"Real users need real tests. Never skip validation after deployment."  
🌷 **Isabella Konti:**  
"Users feel trust through stability. First impressions come from error-free loads."

---

## 🛠️ Step 7: Connected to Azure SQL from Visual Studio  
👩‍💻 **Elina Petrova:**  
"I always test DB access through firewall settings. Allow just enough — no more."  
🧠 **I.K.:**  
"Every access must be a conscious covenant — limited, logged, and time-bound."  
👁️ **Inky Rihan:**  
"Forget to block a public IP? That’s how I sneak in undetected."  
😇 **Maya Lin:**  
“Firewall rules feel like invisible guards… I like that!”

---

## 🛠️ Step 8: Used Code First Migrations to Add New Property  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen:**  
"Think of migrations like app evolution — it learns a new trick without forgetting the old ones!" 🧠  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera:**  
"Track every change — migrations are a journal of your app’s growth."  
👩‍💻 **Elina Petrova:**  
"I automate this in pipelines. Migration errors hurt less when they’re tested."  
👁️ **Inky Rihan:**  
"Misapplied migration? Hello broken app. Hello ShadowNet."

---

## 🛠️ Step 9: Published Code First Changes  
🌷 **Isabella Konti:**  
"When your app evolves, show it gently. Publish only when confident."  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera:**  
"Enable **Execute Code First Migrations** so changes reflect in the cloud DB."

---

## 🛠️ Step 10: Enabled Log Streaming  
🗣️ **Kasper Madsen:**  
"Logs are like your app’s inner monologue. If you listen, it tells you where it hurts."  
🌸 **Sofia Zaymera:**  
"Stream logs during deployment — not just after. It’s like listening during labor."  
🧠 **I.K.:**  
"What is spoken in silence can only be heard by those who attend with stillness."  
😇 **Maya Lin:**  
“I saw logs flying past — like the app was talking to me!”

## 🌈 Final Reflection by Mr. Eks2

“I now see how every task was more than a click — it was a lesson in structure, clarity, and protection.  
I’ll remember the Danish word for ‘flow’ — **strøm** — because that’s what this lab gave me: structured strøm.”

## 🔐 Real-World Reflection (BBC Insight)

One weak password destroyed a 158-year-old firm.  
This lab taught us how to place guardrails — from **firewall rules** to **App Settings** — that stop **ShadowNet** before it gets in.  
Never underestimate the weight of one misconfiguration.
