# Interview Task – Quick Recall Sheet (Lab 19 – ASP.NET App with Azure SQL) 🌐🧠

---

## 🔁 Essential Actions & Intentions

• **Step 1: Downloaded and Extracted Sample App**  
(To begin with a ready-made ASP.NET project — reducing setup time and focusing on deployment learning)

• **Step 2: Ran the App Locally in Visual Studio**  
(To test the logic and UI of the app before deployment — ensuring it behaves as expected)

• **Step 3: Published the App to Azure App Service (Windows)**  
(Used Visual Studio’s integrated publishing tool to deploy the web app — seamless for beginners and professionals)

• **Step 4: Created a New Azure App Service Plan (B1 Tier, East US 2)**  
(To define the compute capacity for the app — a scalable, managed environment for hosting)

• **Step 5: Created a New Azure SQL Server and Azure SQL Database**  
(To host the app’s data layer securely — with admin credentials and regional compliance)

• **Step 6: Configured Connection String and App Settings**  
(Securely passed database credentials to the app — never hard-coded, always encrypted within Azure)

• **Step 7: Published Code First Migrations**  
(Extended the data model with a new property — `Done` — using EF migrations to update schema in Azure)

• **Step 8: Validated Deployment via Browser and SQL Explorer**  
(Accessed live URL and viewed database rows — confirming end-to-end functionality)

• **Step 9: Enabled Log Streaming in Azure**  
(To monitor app behavior in real-time — essential for debugging and performance validation)

• **Step 10: Cleaned Up Azure Resources**  
(To avoid unnecessary costs and maintain cloud hygiene — a best practice for all test labs)

## 🧠 Final Reflection (Mr. Eks2 Style)

“This lab reminded me that cloud apps aren’t just code in the sky — they’re living systems with memory, breath, and purpose.  
From deployment to secrets, each layer carries meaning. I’ll write the Danish word for *connection string* — **forbindelsesstreng** — into my notes.”

## 🔐 Real-World Reminder

Even the cleanest Azure diagram can fall if we forget one password.  
This lab taught us that infrastructure is only as strong as our smallest misstep.  
Let’s never forget the story of a 158-year-old company lost to one compromised password.
