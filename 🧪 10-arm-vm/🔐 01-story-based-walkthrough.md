# 🚀 Lab 10: Deploy a Windows VM Using an ARM Template  
### *From the IronWall-az500-labs — with Mr. eks2, Kasper & Sofia*  

---

## 📌 Lab Title  
**Deploy Smarter with Templates**  

---

## 🔮 Scenario Setup  

Mr. eks2 stepped into the cloud lab room with a thermos of tea and his usual curiosity.  
Kasper greeted him with a grin:  
> “Ready to build a whole virtual world with one magical file?”  

Sofia smiled warmly:  
> “Today, you’ll learn how to deploy a **Windows Virtual Machine** using an **ARM template** — it’s like a recipe for cloud infrastructure.”  

This lab teaches the power of **Infrastructure as Code** — automating deployment with precision, elegance… and zero clicks! 🧙‍♂️✨

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step with Story & Dialogue  

### ☁️ Step 1: Explore the ARM Template  

**Kasper**: “This template is like a LEGO instruction booklet. It tells Azure exactly what to build: a VM, a network, a security gate, and even the driveway!”  

**Sofia**: “Look closely — the **parameters** and **variables** keep things flexible and reusable. It’s clean coding for the cloud.”  

**Mr. eks2**: “So… this one file can make a whole setup? That’s *quite* efficient. It’s like Danish flat-pack furniture!”  

---

### 📤 Step 2: Upload the Template to Cloud Shell  

**Kasper**: “Time to fly it into Azure! In **Cloud Shell**, we upload the template like a blueprint to the foreman.”  

**Sofia**: “And no need to attach a **storage account** this time. We just want to test the magic spell.”  

**Mr. eks2**: “Uploading… feels like sending a message in a bottle — only faster!”  

---

### 🧙 Step 3: Deploy the ARM Template  

**Kasper**: “Now type the command and whoosh — Azure begins building. You’re telling it what to do, line by line.”  

**Sofia**: “Always double-check your **adminUsername** and use a strong password. Never deploy with weak credentials.”  

**Mr. eks2**: “This is… code doing construction work. I love it. So calm, no clicking frenzy.”  

---

### 🔍 Step 4: Verify Deployment in Portal  

**Kasper**: “Hop into the **Resource Group** — check if all your parts arrived: VM, NIC, **VNet**, **NSG**, public IP… like a pizza order, but cloud-style.”  

**Sofia**: “Each resource has a purpose — **NSG** protects, **VNet** connects, **NIC** links the VM to the network.”  

**Mr. eks2**: “They’re like a tiny digital neighborhood! VNet is the street, NSG is the gatekeeper, NIC is the driveway.”  

---

### 🧹 Step 5: Clean Up the Resources  

**Kasper**: “Always tidy up! Delete your **resource group [ressourcegruppe]**, and all the bits inside disappear. It’s like returning LEGO bricks to the box.”  

**Sofia**: “This saves money — and avoids cloud clutter.”  

**Mr. eks2**: “Goodbye, little VM. You were built fast and deleted with love.”

## 🌍 Real-World Reflection  

This lab shows how powerful and clean **Infrastructure as Code** can be. Instead of creating resources manually, you describe everything once — and deploy it all in seconds. For a beginner, this is like discovering you can program the cloud like a robot assistant. Very useful for security, automation, and consistency in real jobs.
