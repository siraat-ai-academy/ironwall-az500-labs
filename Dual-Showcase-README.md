# 🌉 Dual Showcase — Eks2 Documentation Styles

This repository demonstrates the **two faces of my documentation style**:  
- **Story-Driven (Academic / YouTube)** — engaging, character-based explanations for learners.  
- **Professional (Client / Freelance)** — structured, concise documentation for startups, SaaS, and developers.

## 📘 Lab Example: Azure Resource Locks

### 🧑‍🏫 Story-Driven Version (Academic)
```markdown
Mr. eks2 had just finished his morning tea in the cozy café near his cloud security office in Denmark.  
“Godmorgen, Mr. eks2!” smiled Kasper. “Ready to lock down some resources today?”  
...  
👨‍💼 “Ah, like a padlock on a bicycle. You can still ride it, but no one can take it!”  
...  
This lab teaches a very real skill: how to protect cloud resources from accidents or mistakes.
```

**Style**: Narrative, metaphors, multilingual flavor, friendly dialogues.  
**Best For**: Students, YouTube explainer videos, Siraat AI Academy learners.

### 💼 Professional Version (Client)
```markdown
## 📖 Overview
This lab demonstrates how to:
- Create a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure.
- Apply resource locks to prevent accidental changes or deletions.
- Understand the difference between Delete locks and Read-only locks.

## 🚀 Steps
1. Create a VM in Azure Portal (Ubuntu 20.04, B2s, Trusted Launch).
2. Add a Delete Lock named `VMDeleteLock` to the VM.
3. Add a Read-only Lock named `RGReadOnly` to the Resource Group.
4. Test deletion (blocked), remove locks, then clean up resources.

## 📝 Key Takeaways
- Delete Lock: Prevents deletion.
- Read-only Lock: Prevents modifications, allows viewing.
- Locks must be removed before deletion or modification.
```

**Style**: Clear, structured, professional.  
**Best For**: Freelance projects, SaaS documentation, GitHub repos.

## 🌟 Why This Matters
Most writers specialize in one tone.  
I can **switch between both** depending on the audience:  
- Storytelling → when learners need confidence.  
- Professional clarity → when clients need quick results.  

This flexibility is the **Eks2 Signature Method**:  
> “One topic, explained in two worlds — the heart and the market.”
