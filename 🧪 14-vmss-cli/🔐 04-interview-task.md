# ✅ Prompt: Interview Task – Quick Recall Sheet

## 🔖 Prompt Purpose

Generate a single-page summary in professional bullet format titled:

### **“Interview Task – Quick Recall Sheet”**  
for a specific lab (from the above/previous output of the lab).

This summary should compile key steps and briefly state the **"what we do"** and **"(why we do this)"** in each bullet — drawn from the previously generated outputs:

- 🔐 01-story-based-walkthrough.md  
- 🔐 02-tool-fun-facts.md  
- 🔐 03-text-diagram-recap.md  

The goal is to provide a concise, interview-ready reminder for **Mr. eks2** and all readers to recall each lab’s real purpose — not just tasks, but **intentional actions** that build practical understanding of **Azure security** and design logic.
