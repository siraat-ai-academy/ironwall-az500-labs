## Interview Task – Quick Recall Sheet

### Lab 14: Create and manage a Virtual Machine Scale Set Using Azure CLI

- Step 1: We launched **Azure Cloud Shell** *(to access a browser-based CLI environment for managing Azure resources without local setup)*
- Step 2: We selected **Bash and default storage options** *(to quickly initialize a usable environment with minimal configuration)*
- Step 3: We created a **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)** *(to manage and scale a group of virtual machines automatically)*
- Step 4: We used the **Ubuntu2204 image and VM SKU** *(to ensure compatibility and cost-effectiveness for Linux workloads)*
- Step 5: We set **admin username and generated SSH keys** *(to securely authenticate into the VM instances)*
- Step 6: We verified VMSS creation by listing VMs *(to confirm the resource was properly deployed and active)*
- Step 7: We scaled the **VMSS capacity to 3** *(to handle increased workload and test auto-scaling functionality)*
- Step 8: We confirmed updated instance count *(to verify scaling actions were successful)*
- Step 9: We stopped all VMSS instances *(to conserve costs or prepare for updates or maintenance)*
- Step 10: We stopped, deallocated individual VMs *(to manage specific VM state and resources efficiently)*
- Step 11: We started and restarted VMs and VMSS *(to test recovery and reboot capabilities across individual or grouped instances)*
- Step 12: We deleted all resources *(to clean up and prevent unnecessary costs after the lab)*
