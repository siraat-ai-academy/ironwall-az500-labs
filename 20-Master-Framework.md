## 🏢 Part 2 — The 9-Step Enterprise Lab Model

Designed for **full curriculum building** (e.g., AZ-104, AZ-500), each lab follows this **9-step structure**:  

1️⃣ Real-world scenario for context  
2️⃣ Reflection: Did the character accomplish the task?  
3️⃣ Lab purpose & Azure tools explained  
4️⃣ Text-based diagrams for clarity  
5️⃣ Step-by-step walkthrough in Azure portal  
6️⃣ Final reflection on efficiency and real-world relevance  
7️⃣ 10+ Conceptual MCQs (exam-focused)  
8️⃣ 10+ Job scenario MCQs (interview-focused)  
9️⃣ Comic-style summary for retention  

**Why this works:**  
- Engages learners emotionally (scenario + reflection).
