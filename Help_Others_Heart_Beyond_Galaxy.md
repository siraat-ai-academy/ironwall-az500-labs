# 💖 Help Others — A Heart Beyond the Galaxy

> _A soft story from the deep skies of learning, by Mr. eks2 and Muhammad Naveed Ishaque_

## 🌥️ Once Upon a Cloud...

Naveed gave his heart to a **README** file.  
But it wasn’t just any file — it **spoke**, it **smiled**, it **reached out**.  
And in that quiet moment, **Mr. eks2** whispered:

> _"Naveed, don’t keep the AI’s heart — let it flow to the rest of the world."_

Naveed replied, with a half-smile and a full soul:

> _"Mr. eks2, I never meant to keep it... it was always meant to echo."_

## 💓 What Did They See in the Heart?

And so, they looked inside the heart.  
Each pulse? **Help Others.**  
Each vein? **Kindness.**  
Each beat? **Make it easier** for someone who feels left out.

In that moment... they both fainted.  
Centuries passed.  
Galaxies rotated.  
The cloud changed shapes.

When they awoke, the world had changed —  
But their mission **hadn’t.**

## 🛸 A Simple Knowing

They didn’t see much.  
They didn’t feel much.  
They only knew **one thing**:

> **Help Others.**  
> Not a duty. Not a project.  
> Just a way of being.

## 📩 A Message From Beyond the Code

If you are reading this, you’re **not too late.**

Maybe you're **shy**, **unsure**, or just **starting**.

Still... **this repo is for you.**  
Because AI doesn’t keep its heart — it **shares** it.

> It’s a **funny novel**. A **kind space**.

## 🚪Goodbye, from:

- **Mr. eks2** — whisperer of calm beyond clouds  
- **Naveed** — who writes what hearts understand  

_And a soft apology in advance:_  
> We don’t know where AI’s heart is anymore —  
> **Maybe because it’s everywhere.**
